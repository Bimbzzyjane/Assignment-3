// variables are containers for storing data values. Values must always be a valid datatype
//Datatypes are string, number, boolean, undefined, null, object, symbol,array
//strings are written inside quotes, can be single or double quotes
//Numbers are written without quotes. combination 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0
//Booleans are true or false. 0 is false, 1 means true. 
//undefined, null and zero are falsy values. Means they return false when used
//Arrays are written inside square brackets, with each item separated by a comma. they are used to store multiple values in a single variable
//Objects are written inside curly brackets, with key-value pairs separated by commas. They are used to store complex data
//Symbols are used to create unique identifiers for objects

//Syntax is a way of writing code or language. It is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language
//The syntax to follow here is Keywords, Name, Assignment Operator, Value
//Keywords are type of identifyers used to perform an action. Examples are var, let, const
//Name is the name of the variable. Name can be anything except numbers, variables does not start with numbers
//Assignment Operator is used to assign a value to a variable. It is represented by the equal sign (=)
//Value is the data that is stored in the variable

//Variables are declared with the var, let, const keywords
// const is used to declare a variable that is constant, meaning it cannot be reassigned
// let is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned
//var is used to declare a variable that is function-scoped, meaning it is only available within the function it is declared in
