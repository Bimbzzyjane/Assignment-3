// we use the new Promise() constructor to create a new promise.
// The promise constructor takes a function as an argument. This function is called the executor function.
// The executor function takes two functions as arguments: resolve and PromiseRejectionEvent. These are functions provided by javascript
// Inside the executor function, we perform some asynchronous operation.
